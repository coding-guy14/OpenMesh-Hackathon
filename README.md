# Genetic Algorithm for LLM Prompt Generation

## Overview
This project implements a genetic algorithm to optimize prompts for sentiment analysis using GPT-2, a Large Language Model (LLM). The algorithm iteratively evolves prompts to find the most effective ones for accurately categorizing sentiments.

## Features
- Utilizes GPT-2 for advanced natural language processing.
- Implements a custom genetic algorithm for optimizing prompts.
- Includes a fitness function to evaluate the effectiveness of each prompt.
- Features an extensive test suite for thorough validation of the algorithm.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `transformers` and `torch` libraries

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

## Usage
- Main Code -> python3 main.py
- Test Suite -> python3 tests.py

## NOTE
- HyperCycle has not been implemented yet
